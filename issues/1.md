# Spike: Investigate State Persistence and Metadata Unification for Vuln Detector

## Goals

- **State persistence:** Unify metadata structure as done previously in Tier 2. Some fields (to be confirmed by Marcel) should be included in the host context within metadata, and attached to all events.
- **Vuln Detector:** Group all data related to Vulnerability Detector (OS, packages, and hotfixes) into a single package for synchronization purposes.

## Tasks

- Review current metadata structure and identify required fields for host context.
- Consult Marcel for specific metadata requirements.
- Analyze the current handling of Vuln Detector data and define a unified packaging approach for OS, packages, and hotfixes.
- Document findings and propose next steps.
